## Scope
This is a collection of golang code I have found myself repeating again and again and didn't find in any other place (exactly like this).

## Contact
* If you find this code useful feel free to drop me a message at matei@busui.ro (or anywhere you can reach me for that matter).
* If you find an issue feel free to open up one in this repository (or contact me however you like and tell me about it).
